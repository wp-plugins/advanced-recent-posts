Plugin that shows the recent posts with thumbnails in the widget and in other parts of the your blog or theme with shortcodes.

== Description ==

Advanced Recent Posts plugin shows the recent posts with thumbnails in two areas:

* widget in your sidebar
* shortcode in any place of your post or theme.

Customization of the plugin is wery simple an flexible:

* Widgets are configured into Dashboard -> Appearance -> Widgets
* Shortcodes are configured in plugin shortcode builder, you will see it in the admin menu of your WordPress

There are two predefined color schemes (only for basic layout): dark and light, but you can set up your own scheme.

Better to see once than read a hundred times - see the [live demo](http://demo.lp-tricks.com/) on my website :)
